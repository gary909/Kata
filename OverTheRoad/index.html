        Task<br>
        You've just moved into a perfectly straight street with exactly n identical houses on either side of the road. <br>
        Naturally, you would like to find out the house number of the people on the other side of the street. <br>
        The street looks something like this:<br>
        <br>
        Street<br>
        1|   |6<br>
        3|   |4<br>
        5|   |2<br>
        you<br>
        Evens increase on the right; odds decrease on the left. House numbers start at 1 and increase without gaps. <br>
        When n = 3, 1 is opposite 6, 3 opposite 4, and 5 opposite 2.<br>
        <br>
        Example (address, n --> output)<br>
        Given your house number address and length of street n, give the house number on the opposite side of the street.<br>
        <br>
        1, 3 --> 6<br>
        3, 3 --> 4<br>
        2, 3 --> 5<br>
        3, 5 --> 8<br>
    </p>
