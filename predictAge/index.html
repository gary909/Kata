        My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!<br>
        <br>
        In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!<br>
        <br>
        Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.<br>
        Multiply each number by itself.<br>
        Add them all together.<br>
        Take the square root of the result.<br>
        Divide by two.<br>
        <br>
        Example<br>
        <br>
        predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) === 86<br>
        <br>
        Note: the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.<br>
