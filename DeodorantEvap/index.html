    <p>
        This program tests the life of an evaporator containing a gas.<br>
        <br>
        We know the content of the evaporator (content in ml), the percentage of foam or gas lost every <br>
        day (evap_per_day) and the threshold (threshold) in percentage beyond which the evaporator is no <br>
        longer useful. All numbers are strictly positive.<br>
        <br>
        The program reports the nth day (as an integer) on which the evaporator will be out of use.<br>
        <br>
        Example:<br>
        evaporator(10, 10, 5) -> 29<br>
        Note:<br>
        Content is in fact not necessary in the body of the function "evaporator", you can use it or not <br>
        use it, as you wish. Some people might prefer to reason with content, some other with percentages <br>
        only. It's up to you but you must keep it as a parameter because the tests have it as an argument.<br>
