        Story<br>
        Your online store likes to give out coupons for special occasions. Some customers try to cheat <br>
        the system by entering invalid codes or using expired coupons.<br>
        <br>
        Task<br>
        Your mission:<br>
        Write a function called checkCoupon which verifies that a coupon code is valid and not expired.<br>
        <br>
        A coupon is no more valid on the day AFTER the expiration date. All dates will be passed as strings <br>
        in this format: "MONTH DATE, YEAR".<br>
        <br>
        Examples:<br>
        checkCoupon("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 9, 2015")  ===  true<br>
        checkCoupon("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 2, 2015")  ===  false<br>
    </p>
