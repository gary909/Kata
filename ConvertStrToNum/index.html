        Oh no!<br>
        Some really funny web dev gave you a sequence of numbers from his API response as an sequence of strings!<br>
<br>
        You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.<br>
<br>
        Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.<br>
<br>
        ie:["1", "2", "3"] to [1, 2, 3]<br>
<br>
        Note that you can receive floats as well.<br>
