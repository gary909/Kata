    <p>
        Consider the word "abode". We can see that the letter a is in position 1 and b <br>
        is in position 2. In the alphabet, a and b are also in positions 1 and 2. Notice <br>
        also that d and e in abode occupy the positions they would occupy in the alphabet, <br>
        which are positions 4 and 5.<br>
        <br>
        Given an array of words, return an array of the number of letters that occupy their <br>
        positions in the alphabet for each word. For example,<br>
        <br>
        solve(["abode","ABc","xyzD"]) = [4, 3, 1]<br>
        See test cases for more examples.<br>
        <br>
        Input will consist of alphabet characters, both uppercase and lowercase. No spaces.<br>
